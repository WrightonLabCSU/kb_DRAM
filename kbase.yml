module-name:
    kb_DRAM

module-description:
    <p>If you have any difficulty using this app, email Rory.Flynn@colostate.edu for help.</p>

    <p>Visit the Tutorial <add link> to see detailed instructions on how to run this app in KBase.</p>

    <p>b_DRAM utilizes three different input file types:<\p>

    <p>(1) For the annotation of microbial DNA sequences from assemblies, isolate genomes, or metagenome assembled genomes, use KBase assembly objects<\p>

    <p>(2) For the annotation of predicted coding sequences from microbial genomes, use KBase genome objects<\p>

    <p>(3) For the annotation of viral genomes identified form metagenomes using DRAM-v, use Ishock ID from the KBase VirSorter Summary<\p>
